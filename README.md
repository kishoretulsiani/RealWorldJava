#### What is Web server & Application server
1. Web server: serves content to the web using http protocol.
2. Application server: hosts and exposes business logic and processes.

#### Jetty
Jetty is a lightweight servlet container, easy to embed within a java application, there is an easy to use jetty client also.

Jetty is a web server (HTTP), similar to the likes of Tomcat and such, but lighter than most servlet containers. This is closer to the traditional Java way of doing server applications (servlets, WAR files).

#### Netty
Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server.

The main advantage of Netty over simply reading from and writing to sockets using streams is that Netty supports non-blocking, asynchronous I/O (using Java's NIO API); when you use streams to read and write from sockets (and you start a new thread for each connected accepted from a ServerSocket) you are using blocking, synchronous I/O.

#### Springboot
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

#### Vert.x
Vert.x is an entire toolkit and ecosystem of pluggable modules on top of Netty for building reactive applications on top of the JVM.
